      "message": "You need to add core context here, otherwise the check is going to be done against adminconsole-administrateServer and would always fail. Well it probably worked for you because the check respects administrateServer anyway. It is documented in [1]:\n\nCapability scope was introduced to differentiate between plugin-owned capabilities and core capabilities. Per default the scope of the @RequiresCapability annotation is CapabilityScope.CONTEXT, that means:\n\nwhen @RequiresCapability is used within a plugin the scope of the capability is assumed to be that plugin.\nIf @RequiresCapability is used within the core Gerrit Code Review server (and thus is outside of a plugin) the scope is the core server and will use the GlobalCapability known to Gerrit Code Review server.\nIf a plugin needs to use a core capability name (e.g. \"administrateServer\") this can be specified by setting scope \u003d CapabilityScope.CORE:\n\n@RequiresCapability(value \u003d \"administrateServer\", scope \u003d\n    CapabilityScope.CORE)\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-plugins.html#capabilities",
