      "message": "My goal was to exemplify or ease the occasional use of a snapshot version. I can work on improving this and addressing your concern in a stable-3.0 based round of follow-up changes. I propose so because this approach started downstream that way.\n\nSo can we 1. approve this round, then 2. push a downstream new round to amend? That amend could include a version-agnostic short usage comment. But it would not be meant for commenting in and out.",
